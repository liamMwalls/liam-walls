# Services

All services used in this angular application should be placed in this folder,
even if they're only used in one place by one module. We want to be able to
show a developer new to a project all the moving parts at a glance.

## What?

Services are used when:

- You need to reuse functions across your application.
- You want to only define data structures once across your application (think API endpoints etc...)

## How

Here's an example service:

    (function() {
        'use strict'

        angular.module('moduleName.service', [])
            .service('helpers', function() {

                /**
                 * A safe way to use console.log without breaking older browsers.
                 *
                 * @param message : string,
                 * the message you want to appear in the log
                 *
                 * @param useAlert : bool
                 * Set to true if you want to run an alert when the console is
                 * unavailable.
                 */
                this.log = function (message, useAlert) {
                    if (typeof console == "object") {
                        console.log(message);
                    } else if (useAlert) {
                        alert(message);
                    }
                }

            });
    })();
